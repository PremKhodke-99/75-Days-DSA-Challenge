A child is running up a staircase with N steps. The child can hop either 1 step, 2 steps or 3 steps at a time. Can you write a program to count the number of possible ways in which the child can run up the staircase.

Input format
Single line with N, number of steps

Output format
Number of different ways to climb, mod 1000000007

Constraints
1 <= N <= 100000

Sample Input 1
3

Sample Output 1
4

Explanation 1
These are the possible ways in which the child can climb up the 3 step staircase:

One single hop of 3 steps (3)

Two step hop followed by a one step hop (2 + 1)

One step hop followed by a two step hop (1 + 2)

Three one step hops (1 + 1 + 1)

Problem Description
A matrix and a valid current position (row number and column number) are provided as input. Given a direction (RIGHT is 1, DOWN in 2, LEFT is 3 and UP is 4) and number of steps to move, output the values along the path taken to the new position, including the value at the new position.

If any position during traversal is out of bounds, output a single -1 and not the values along the path.

Input format
First line contains two space separated integers M and N, representing the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively.

Next M lines contain N space separated integers each, which represent the values on each row

Next line contains two space separated integers X and Y, representing the row and column number you are currently at. This is 0 based indexing.

Next line contains two space separated integers A and B, representing the Direction and the Number of steps to move, respectively.

Output format
Output the values along the path, in a space separated way.

Constraints
1 <= M,N,X,Y <= 1000

0 <= Matrix values <= 1e9

1 <= A <= 4

1 <= B <= 1e9

Sample Input 1
3 3 --> Matrix size

1 2 3 --> Input matrix of 3 rows

4 5 6

7 8 9

1 1 --> Current Position

1 1 --> Direction, # of steps; In this case move RIGHT by 1 step

Sample Output 1
6

Explanation 1
We start at the position with value 5 (1 1) and move 1 step right to get to value 6 (at position 1 2), so we print 6.

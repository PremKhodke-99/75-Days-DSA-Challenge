Problem Description
You are given a X positive integer. You need to find the N-th root of X.

If the N-th root is in decimal you need to print its floor value e.g, floor(3.23) = 3.

Input format
First line contains T i.e, the number of test cases.

Each test case has a single line that contains two positive integers, X and N.

Output format
For each test case print the floor(N-th root of X) in a new line.

Sample Input 1
4 2

Sample Output 1
2

Explanation
For X = 4 and N = 2 => (4) ^ (1/2) = 2. And floor(2) = 2
